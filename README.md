# DEPI Data Engineering Capstone  
**Project Title:** Real-time IoT Data Pipeline  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains our final graduation project for the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) – Data Engineering Track**.  
The project demonstrates how to build a **real-time IoT data pipeline** that collects, processes, and visualizes sensor data.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Simulate IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity).  
- Build a batch ETL pipeline for data cleaning and storage.  
- Implement a real-time streaming pipeline with alerts.  
- Visualize data in an interactive dashboard.  
- Provide full documentation and final presentation.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Data Simulation, ETL, Processing)  
- **SQL / Data Lake** (Storage)  
- **Kafka / Azure Stream Analytics** (Streaming)  
- **Power BI / Streamlit / Grafana** (Dashboard)
